# introduction

this script is based on http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XenStore function,

I've created a bash library (kv2xml) to convert this "k/e/y/path=value" output to XML

this is a use case of kv2xml

# get started

  *  create a config.sh file based on config.sh.dist 
  *  config.sh : change KV2XML_PATH to your kv2xml path
  *  launch xsdumpXML.sh
